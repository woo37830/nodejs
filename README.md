# nodejs
Experimental repository to learn node.js
Create the server and expand it.  Start with Hello, World
Had to download a favicon.ico and put it into the directory
with server.js and index.html to prevent error about favicon.ico not found.

Run node server.js and enter localhost:8081/index.html to see Hello, World, but not correct favicon!
then run node express_server.js and enter localhost:8081 to see Hello World from code.

Still not handline all.  Next handle GET POST, etc., forms and then static pages and routing.
